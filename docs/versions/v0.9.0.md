# Version v0.9.0

This is the documentation for version 0.9.0 of the project.

## New Features

- Added a new way of deploying the operator using Helm charts. This allows for easier integration with existing Kubernetes clusters and simplifies the deployment process. Check the [Installation Guide](/getting-started) for more details.

## Fixes

- Fixed scenarios where the template was not properly split by `---`. Moved to using kubernetes apimachinery method, which is the same that kubectl uses to split the template.

## Release

Check out the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/eryalito/kubensync-operator/releases/tag/v0.9.0)
